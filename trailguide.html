            <h2>About TrailGuide</h2>
            <p>TrailGuide is an app that makes exploring the wilderness accessible to anyone. It allows you to quickly and easily find nearby nature trails and activities, and shows you what wildlife is waiting to be discovered wherever you are.</p>
          </div><!--end container used for text section-->
          <div><!--open container used for text section-->
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>I started the design process of the TrailGuide app with two primary goals to be accomplished:</p>
            <p>1. Create a native app for both iOS and Android that provides users with the ability to experience local nature areas and activities more fully.</p>
            <p>2. Establish meaningful incentives within the product that would encourage user retention.</p>
          </div><!--end container used for text section-->
          <div><!--open container used for text section-->
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>I designed this product from the initial concept to final deliverables. I also received collaborative input, criticism, and feedback from another fellow designer in order to improve my designs and my process.</p>
            <h3>Main Tasks</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Research and Concept</li>
              <li>Wireframes and Prototype</li>
              <li>Usability Test</li>
              <li>UI and Visual Design</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>My Design Process</h2>
            <p>My design process began with research. With the high level goals for the project set, I sought to take an audit of other competitive products to understand their strengths and weaknesses. Using that information I then set out to define a potential solution through brainstorming and narrowing relevant features.</p>
            <p>With this direction in mind, my next step was to iterate ideas through sketches and wireframes.</p>
            <p>Once I had landed on a design that could be an effective solution, I build a prototype and gave it to users to test. After I used the results of the user tests to refine the design, the product was materialized as I created the visual design and interface.</p>

            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <h1>Research</h1>
          </div><!--end container used for headline-->
          <div><!--open container used for text section-->
            <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
            <p>There are many variations of navigation and outdoors apps available with a wide range of target users, features, and overall experiences. I choose to look at four such competitors in depth to glean whatever useful data I could from their design and implementations.</p>
            <h3>Competitors</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>AllTrails</li>
              <li>REI National Parks</li>
              <li>Google Maps</li>
              <li>Audubon Field Guide</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Insights</h3>
            <p>The apps considered are all quite different from each other and have different end goals. However since they are all different I was able to draw a number of both common and unique insights that would help me in my design:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Products that have user engagement and retention provide value to users. AllTrails engages and retains users with a membership program while an app like Audubon allows users to keep track their own located birds over time.</li>
              <li>Navigation and recommendation features are a key part of user experience. Detailed maps and use of GPS location are paired with user ratings and reviews to help users find new experiences they might enjoy.</li>
              <li>Users benefit from detailed information. When information about a location, activity, or sight is communicated with specificity and good hierarchy, users are able to make better decisions and have deeper experiences.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These insights helped me move on to conceptualizing potential solutions that could bring added value to users.</p>

          </div><!--end container used for headline-->
          <div><!--open container used for text section-->
            <h2>The Users</h2>
            <p>For this project, since there were no user interviews conducted, I referred to my research and made educated assumptions to create three quick target user personas to inform and direct me as I designed solutions for their potential needs.</p>
          </div><!--end container used for text section-->

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Based on the preliminary goals of the project, and taking into account the insights from my initial research and target user personas, I defined a point of view statement to generate ideas for potential solutions.</p>
            <h3>POV Statement</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>A user needs a way to easily find nearby trails and related outdoors information, because they want to enjoy local nature more fully, and they want to be able to personalize their experience based on their prior skill and knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With this primary problem determined from the user’s point of view I wrote a number of “how might we” questions. This helped me brainstorm out and narrow down the best possible solutions for this product.</p>
            <h3>HMW Questions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>How might we give people easier access to nature experiences?</li>
              <li>How might we make it easier for people to find trails that fit their skill level?</li>
              <li>How might we help people connect with nature during their outdoor activities?</li>
            </ul>
          </div><!--end container used for text section-->
          <div><!--open container used for text section-->
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>After selecting the key HMW questions and the associated solutions, I consolidated the results into a solution summary. These are the main features I designed the app around in order to help our users achieve their goals.</p>
            <h3>Finding Outdoor Activities</h3>
            <p>Since our users are looking for exciting and rewarding experiences outdoors, the app’s primary function is to help them quickly and easily locate trails and activities that will fit their desires and encourage them to learn more. This includes the following key features:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Interactive GPS map with nearby trails and activities</li>
              <li>Advanced search feature for trails and activities</li>
              <li>Trail and activity categories based on popular search data</li>
              <li>Trail and activity pages with ratings, reviews, and details</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Finding Local Wildlife</h3>
            <p>In order for users to experience nature more fully while they explore these trails and activities the app will allow them to learn what local wildlife to look for and provide them with detailed information about each creature. Users will also be able keep a record on the app of the wildlife they have found along with pictures of their sightings. This helps the user engage with their surroundings while encouraging them to return to the app to learn more and update their progress. Key features included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Detailed field guide with nearby wildlife</li>
              <li>Advanced search feature for wildlife</li>
              <li>Camera</li>
              <li>Tag and save wildlife sightings</li>
            </ul>

          <div><!--open container used for text section-->
            <h2>User Flow</h2>
            <p>After defining our problem and concept for the solution I designed a user flow to accomplish users’ goals. Using Whimsical I mapped out basic structure of the app and how users would flow through each necessary screen.</p>
          </div><!--end container used for text section-->

          <div><!--open container used for text section-->
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>With the user flow planned out I sketched a number of quick of ideas for each screen with Procreate and selected the best solutions. Then I further developed these into medium fidelity wireframes for both iOS and Android versions of the app.</p>
          </div><!--end container used for text section-->
          <div><!--open container used for picture-->

            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <h1>Test</h1>
          </div><!--end container used for headline-->
          <div><!--open container used for text section-->
            <h2>User Testing</h2>
            <p>To ensure optimum usability I built a prototype of the app and used it to conduct user testing with participants from our target user groups. Users in the test easily navigated through most of the app and exposed the following pain points:</p>
            <h3>Access Map for Search</h3>
            <p>During the usability test 25% of users indicated that when they were attempting to begin a search for a trail on the home screen they got stuck when they expected to see a map icon but couldn’t locate one. I remedied this by adding a map button next to the search box.</p>
            <h3>Add Wildlife Sighting</h3>
            <p>It was not discoverable to users that they could enter a wildlife sighting and it was unclear how to do so. I solved this by including an informative onboarding screen, I updated CTA button to be more clear, and I created a new ‘add sighting’ screen to more easily inform the user and help them through the flow.</p>
            <h3>Sort by Difficulty</h3>
            <p>Users with different skill levels asked for the ability to quickly sort trails by difficulty. While this feature was already included, I made it more prominent by highlighting the difficulty on the trail cards and adding a difficulty category to the search screen.</p>
          </div><!--end container used for text section-->
          <div><!--open container used for headline-->
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <h1>Materialize</h1>
          </div><!--end container used for headline-->
          <div><!--open container used for text section-->
            <h2>Colors</h2>
            <p>To craft the visual design I started with color. I selected the main blue and green for their clear relationship to the waters and vegetation of nature. Orange and yellow were chosen as accents since they are often used to identify people within nature, such as in outdoor clothing or gear. The colors are bright to capture the fun of adventure and are slightly less saturated to evoke vintage outdoors guides and gear.</p>

          <div><!--open container used for text section-->
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>I chose Playfair for the headlines since the serif font echos the nostalgia of old field guides while still maintaining a fresh and modern feel. The body fonts are the standard fonts used for each respective operating system.</p>

            <h2>Imagery</h2>
            <p>Imagery is extensively used and carefully chosen in the TrailGuide app since it can provide users with a window into the kind of outdoor experiences they are looking for. Selected images display the majestic beauty of local nature, highlight local wildlife, and feature darker colors with dramatic lighting to capture the primal wilds.</p>

          <div><!--open container used for text section-->
            <h2>Illustration</h2>
            <p>I chose to design custom illustrations for the app based on vintage illustrated field guides from the mid 20th century with a touch of modern flat design. This was to evoke the feeling of adventure and nostalgia while still providing simple and helpful reference to users who need to easily identify local wildlife.</p>

            <h2>Final User Interface</h2>
            <p>The last step was to put together the high fidelity user interface for each screen of the app for both iOS and Android.</p>
          </div><!--end container used for text section-->
          <div><!--open container used for text section-->
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>When the app is opened users can create an account, log in with their existing credentials, or they can choose to skip the login process to go directly to the home screen and begin to search for trails, activities, or wildlife.</p>

            <h2>Onboarding</h2>
            <p>It is important to quickly and efficiently explain to users what they can do with the app so that when they get started they are aware of its capabilities and can easily orient themselves to start using it to accomplish their goals.</p>

            <h2>Home Screen</h2>
            <p>The home screen will recommend local trails and activities based on the users location. From here users can access all of the various features and flows of the product. A skeleton page is used since research indicates it gives users the perception of slightly faster loading times compared to a blank screen or loading spinner.</p>

            <h2>Wildlife Sighting</h2>
            <p>When a user spots a creature on a trail or an activity they can record the sighting with details and images using the camera feature. The app will give them feedback for their sighting and future iterations could include trophies or rewards for the wildlife they locate. This would increase engagement and retention while providing value to the user.</p>

            <h2>Designed for Android</h2>
            <p>All screens were taken through the design process and optimized for the Android operating system as well as for iOS. Material Design guidelines were followed while still maintaining a unified design between each version of the app.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>This project was an enjoyable experience to design since it is an app I would love to use myself. These were among the most important lessons I learned as I designed:</p>
            <h3>User Flows are Foundational</h3>
            <p>This project reinforced to me why user flow diagrams are useful and so important to do well in the design of a product. Some of the usability issues I saw arise in the user tests helped me understand how to improve my user flows to make better prototypes in the future.</p>
            <h3>Adaptability is Essential</h3>
            <p>While it is always important to have a clear vision and plan for the design process, it’s not always possible to flesh out every step with the ideal time or resources. That is why it is important to have a good grasp on the design process so you can adapt as needed. For this project, since there were no user interviews done at the beginning, I made sure to pay special attention to the participants during the user tests to try to learn even more about their needs and desires to fill in the gaps.</p>
